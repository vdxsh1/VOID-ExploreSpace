A simple, interactive Solar System Simulation project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project lets users navigate through different planets and learn about their properties in an intuitive, rotating carousel-like interface.

i as a person who really loves astronomy and i'd like to integrate this projact in the future with better animations, transitions and hopefully more features like
quiz, more info on satellites and also horoscopes and constillations.
thankyou so much <3
