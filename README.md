A simple, interactive Solar System Simulation project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project lets users navigate through different planets and learn about their properties in an intuitive, rotating carousel-like interface.
FEATURES:
--> Interactive Planet Carousel: Navigate between planets like Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.
--> Real-Time Info: View descriptions, types, orbital periods, radii, and images of each celestial body.
--> Dynamic Rotations: The planets and their backgrounds rotate smoothly as you navigate between them.
--> Responsive Design: Designed to work across various screen sizes.

i as a person really loves astronomy and i'd like to integrate this projact in the future with better animations, transitions and hopefully more features like
quiz, more info satellites and also horoscopes and constillations.
